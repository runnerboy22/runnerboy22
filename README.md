### @ Play
- I love spinning up new repos to experiment with my latest project ideas.
- As such, I am unnecessarily competent at initializing apps!

### @ Home
- Living with veganism since 2015
- Listening to Audible books (shoutout Michael Lewis)
- Running: when going really far, I might incorporate all 3 at once!
