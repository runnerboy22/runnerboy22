Lead Software Engineer on Verizon Automation Team
- We automate on-prem builds for physical servers and VMs like it's going out of fashion.
- I own development of our tool for managing physical server operations.
- I'm responsible for leading system architecture decisions and code implementation details.

### @ Play
- I love spinning up new repos to experiment with my latest project ideas.
- As such, I am unnecessarily competent at initializing apps!

### @ Home
- Living with veganism since 2015.
- Listening to Audible books (shoutout Michael Lewis).
- Running: when going really far, I might incorporate all 3 at once!
